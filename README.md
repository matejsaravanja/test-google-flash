## About
This code was generated by [CodeCraftAI](https://codecraft.name)

**User requests:**
I want you to build me an app for buying premium NFTs. I want user to pay me 100 CRAFT (of course, user has to sign transaction). That transaction and user ownership of certain NFT should be stored somewhere. CRAFT is a Solana-based token btw. Once paid, user has to get access to that NFT in form of web, mail and image. For NFTs, generate some nice svg images.

## Project Plan
```
Okay, based on these requirements, here's a project plan.  I'm structuring this as a phased approach, allowing for iterative development and early validation.  Note that this is a high-level plan, and each task will need further sub-tasks and details fleshed out.

**Project Name:** CRAFT NFT Marketplace

**Goal:** Develop and deploy a web application for selling dynamically generated SVG NFTs using the CRAFT token on the Solana blockchain.

**Project Phases:**

1.  **Setup and Foundation (2 weeks)**
2.  **Blockchain and Payment Integration (3 weeks)**
3.  **NFT Generation and Delivery (3 weeks)**
4.  **Frontend Development (4 weeks)**
5.  **Testing, Security, and Deployment (2 weeks)**

**Phase 1: Setup and Foundation (2 weeks)**

*   **Goal:** Establish the basic project architecture, set up development environments, and define core data models.

*   **Tasks:**

    *   **1.1 Project Setup (2 days):**
        *   Create project repositories (Frontend, Backend).
        *   Set up version control (Git).
        *   Initialize React frontend with a basic layout (Create React App or similar).
        *   Initialize Python backend with a basic API framework (Flask, FastAPI, Django REST Framework). Choose one based on familiarity and project needs. FastAPI may be preferable for performance due to asynchronous support.
        *   Establish communication between frontend and backend (basic API calls).
        *   Define API endpoints and data structures related to NFTs, user accounts, and transactions.
        *   Setup project management tool (Jira, Trello, Asana)
    *   **1.2 Database Design & Setup (3 days):**
        *   **Decision:** Choose database or blockchain for ownership record.
            * Proposal one: using a traditional database  (PostgreSQL, MySQL).
            * Proposal two: writing the ownership information to the blockchain itself. In this solution, the database will be replaced with the blockchain.
        *   Design DB schema (if using DB), including tables for Users, NFTs, and Transactions. Columns should include user ID, NFT ID, transaction hash, timestamp, etc.
        *   Set up database connection in Python backend.
        * Suggesting blockchain solution for data persistance
    *   **1.3 User Authentication (5 days):**
        *   Implement user registration and login functionality.
        *   Consider using a library like `bcrypt` for password hashing.

        *   Use the Solana SDKs to create and sign transactions.
        *   Handle transaction signing via the connected wallet.
        *   Ensure sufficient error handling for failed transactions (e.g., insufficient balance, network issues).
        *   Write to blockchain or database
    *   **2.3 Transaction Verification (5 days):**
        *   Implement logic to verify that the CRAFT token transfer was successful on the Solana blockchain.
        *   Poll the blockchain for transaction confirmation.
        *   Consider using a Solana RPC endpoint for transaction status lookup.
    *   **2.4 Payment Confirmation (4 days):**
        *   Upon successful transaction verification, update ownership information for the purchased NFT in database or blockchain.
        *   Update the user interface to reflect successful purchase.

*   **Technical Considerations:**

    *   Wallet Adapter Selection: Choose a popular and well-maintained wallet adapter.
    *   Transaction Fees:  Consider how transaction fees (gas) will be handled and communicated to the user.
    *   Security Audits:  Conduct thorough security audits of the code related to Solana transactions to prevent vulnerabilities.

**Phase 3: NFT Generation and Delivery (3 weeks)**
